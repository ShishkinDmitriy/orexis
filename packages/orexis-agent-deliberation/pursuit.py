"""Pursuit: plan, commit the head as an intention, hand it down to be carried out. One road.

**This is what happens to a want, and it is deliberation's because the first step is the
search.** It used to be three things by trigger: the keeper's tick carried out Observe alone,
the bidder re-asked the deliberator inside `submit` when a round knocked, and the actuator
asked on its own reading — each adopting its own intention with its own reason. The search
was one road and execution was three, and a plan's `via` — WHICH lever, half of what a step
says — was dropped between the planner and the ledger.

Now every trigger arrives here and none of them decides. `pursue(agent, desire)`:

1. PLAN — `deliberator.decide(desire)`, the search, answering with rows;
2. COMMIT — every step to the keeper, the head stood at, `progression:through` the lever,
   `progression:pursues` the desire. Absorbed within patience means nothing to carry out;
3. TAKE — handed DOWN to progression's `carry_out`, which asks the T-Box who takes the action
   and runs the take on the reactive loop. False from every actor is "not now": the intention
   stands and the next trigger finds it.

**The plan is handed down whole** (#510, progression-steps-through-a-plan-on-confirmed-feedback):
every step goes to the keeper, the head is taken, and each further step is taken when the
world confirms the one before it — by feedback, with no search above it. A plan in progress
is not searched over again until it lapses or the world contradicts it; that is the
amortisation, moved from "adopt absorbs the same head" to "a standing plan is not re-decided".

This file and progression's `execution.py` were one `agent/execution.py`; the layer split cut
it at the one line where deciding stops and doing starts. See knowledge/domain/executor.md and
knowledge/decisions/an-intention-is-a-plan-committed-to.md.
